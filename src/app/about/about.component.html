        Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are disorders of the heart and blood
        vessels including, coronary heart disease (heart attacks),
        cerebrovascular diseases (strokes), heart failure (HF), and other types
        of pathology. Altogether, cardiovascular diseases cause the death of
        approximately 17 million people worldwide annually, with fatalities
        figures on the rise for first time in 50 years the United Kingdom. In
        particular, heart failure occurs when the heart is unable to pump enough
        blood to the body, and it is usually caused by diabetes, high blood
        pressure, or other heart conditions or diseases. The clinical community
        groups heart failure into two types based on the ejection fraction
        value, that is the proportion of blood pumped out of the heart during a
        single contraction, given as a percentage with physiological values
        ranging between 50% and 75%. The former is heart failure due to reduced
        ejection fraction (HFrEF), previously known as heart failure due to left
        ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction or systolic heart failure and
        characterized by an ejection fraction smaller than 40%. The latter is
        heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), formerly called
        diastolic heart failure or heart failure with normal ejection fraction.
        In this case, the left ventricle contracts normally during systole, but
        the ventricle is stiff and fails to relax normally during diastole, thus
        impairing filling.

        Regarding the features, the creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) states the
        level of the CPK enzyme in blood. When a muscle tissue gets damaged, CPK
        flows into the blood. Therefore, high levels of CPK in the blood of a
        patient might indicate a heart failure or injury. The ejection fraction
        states the percentage of how much blood the left ventricle pumps out
        with each contraction. The serum creatinine is a waste product generated
        by creatine, when a muscle breaks down. Especially, doctors focus on
        serum creatinine in blood to check kidney function. If a patient has
        high levels of serum creatinine, it may indicate renal dysfunction.
        Sodium is a mineral that serves for the correct functioning of muscles
        and nerves. The serum sodium test is a routine blood exam that indicates
        if a patient has normal levels of sodium in the blood. An abnormally low
        level of sodium in the blood might be caused by heart failure. The death
        event feature, that we use as the target in our binary classification
        study, states if the patient died or survived before the end of the
        follow-up period, that was 130 days on average. The original dataset
        article unfortunately does not indicate if any patient had primary
        kidney disease, and provides no additional information about what type
        of follow-up was carried out.
